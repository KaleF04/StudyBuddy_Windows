  Study Buddy is a software that can be used to help you study. Students like me can freely use the software for FREE. This software aims to help students like me study better through the use of technology. How does it work? You or other people can make a template filled with questions. What kind of questions you ask? Any kind, it's up to you. Having a quiz tomorrow? Make a mock-up and answer it using Study Buddy!
